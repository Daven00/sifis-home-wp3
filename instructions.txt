*General steps

1. Run the config.sh script

2. Start Eclipse, then import the following projects:
californium-group-oscore
ace

3. To "ace" add the following folders to the build path:
californium-core
element-connector
oscore-cf
scandium

To add dependencies:
Right click project->Properties->Java Build Path->Add...


*MySQL installation

Note that mySQL is needed for the ACE parts to run correctly. To install it use:
apt-get install mysql-server

Then place a file under ace/db.pwd with the database root password.
Also place a file under vinnova-prototype/db.pwd with the database root password.

*Updating the JCE (Java Cryptography Extensions)

If some of the JUnit tests fail due to "invalid key size" you may need to update the JCE.

In such case follow these instructons:

*Support for Base64

Note that at least Java 8 must be used to have support for java.util.Base64
